/*
First of all, what is "#include" and "<iostream>"?

#include

    - Read this as "import", this is use do bring a library to
    our document, so we can use their functions.

    ***
    Functions are "actions" that our code will be able to execute, like
    put some text in the screen, what we will see next.
    ***

<iostream>

    Is the name of a native library from C, a library is like a kit
    of functions, to use a function of a library we need to import it, following:

    include <libraryname>

    ***
    Native, in other words, means "natural of the language", it is: it already comes with the language
    without needing to install (we can install libraries from others too, but don't worry about it now).
